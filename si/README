si is a socket library written more than 20 years ago (1995) to supoprt DOS based applications
which needed to manage communications via TCP or UDP.  Over the years it has beem extended to 
support IPv6, and multicast, but little else (other than bug fixes) has changed.  It's a callback
oriente library meaning that the user programme initialises, registers call back functions for 
data, connections, etc. and then invokes the SIwait() function to 'drive.'   

The sitest.c programme can be used as an example, and can be built to test the library. 

Requirements:
	mk -- plan-9's version of make by Andrew Hume. 
	

Building:
	If mk is installed, then just mk should build.  By default 'mk publish' will push the resulting
library into /usr/local/lib/sdaniels. You can override this with environment variables.  'mk help' will
list the variables that can be set.
