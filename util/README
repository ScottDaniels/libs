A collection of small utilities which build into libut.a.
	ut.h			header file w/ prototypes

	base64 			base64 encode/decode functions
	sha1			sha-256 encode functions
	tokenise 		string tokeniser
	websocket		basic websocket interface
	websocket_ssl	basic websocekt interface supporting ssl


Requirements when linking with this libary:
	open-ssl development
	ghc-cryptohash-sha256-devel (sha356 development of some kind)


Most of the modles in this libary have a 'self test' bit of code
such that when the module is compiled directly (e.g. mk sha1) the
resulting binary is a small test of the functions found in the 
module.
